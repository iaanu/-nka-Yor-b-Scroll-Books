ÒNKA YORÙBÁ - THE NEW YORUBA NUMERIC SYSTEM
The New Ònka Yorùbá Numeric System is a revolution in motion, a sacred declaration of Yoruba numerical sovereignty. For centuries, the Yoruba tongue has sung, prayed, and dreamed, yet faltered when called to calculate, code, or command the digital future. No longer. Here, the reformed Ònka Yorùbá Numeric System rises in full power: a logic-ready, base-10 Afro-Decimal Framework that transforms poetic complexity into precision, speed, and clarity. Every number now flows with ancestral rhythm and modern fluency. This is the future's minds coming back to life. where children compute in the same voice, they use to greet their elders, and innovators build algorithms in the language of their soul.
The new Yorùbá numeric system delivers complete, interactive ecosystem, featuring essential toolkit suites like the Ònka Yorùbá Number Generator, Yorùbá Calculator, Onka Ojóorí (Age Calculator), Yorùbá Kàlẹ́ndà, and the Number Converter app that makes mathematical concepts immediate and intuitive. The system's scalability and sophistication is demonstrated by a living proof of a printed sequence that runs continuously from 0 to 10 million, with an extended index of Nine Hundred Decillion numbers to learn, and Nine Hundred Decillion Multipliers to master absolutely FREE.
Yorubas, and other indigenous speakers around the world are now empowered to perform advanced computations, access deep-rooted numerical concepts, and develop mathematical algorithms at any complexity or scale, as the future requires languages to speak in code, run seamless simulations, and lead in Global Artificial Intelligence.
This system ensures Yorubas, and other indigenous speakers will not just stand and watch the AI era, but pioneer. Freely given. Fearlessly shared. Under an unrestricted Public Use License, every chart, algorithm, app design, curriculum, and concept is released free to humanity-no permission needed, no barriers imposed. Teachers, developers, students, and dreamers: take it, translate it, code it, teach it online, and anywhere. Let it live in classrooms across Lagos, London, Brasília, New York City, Londrina, Salvador, São Paulo in Brazil; Havana in Cuba, and Lagos again. Let it power software in Silicon Valley and village cooperatives alike. A New linguistic freedom is emerging, one that is scientifically advanced and spiritually strong. This book advocates for the adoption of the New Ònka Yorùbá Numeric System among All indigenous languages, presenting it as a transformative tool for expanding intellectual capacity, improving learning systems, and fostering overall success.
